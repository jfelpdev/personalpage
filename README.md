# personalpage V. 1.1

I've been thinking for a while about making a page to show my work, social networks and that kind of stuff. 
So seeing that many companies are using link systems like linktree I said. Why not use this kind of redirector, along with github pages to create my web page, because this is a short project and does not represent a big challenge, but I see that every day is more necessary to have a web page, almost independently of what career you are in, but much more if you are in the area of technology. 

I hope you like it and if you want to use this little project for you, use it with total freedom.
